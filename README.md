# Overview

Employing C++, I adeptly engineered a sophisticated banking system, leveraging key programming constructs such as variables, expressions, conditionals, loops, functions, and data structures sourced from the Standard Template Library (STL). The meticulously crafted system facilitates the seamless creation of new accounts, offering functionalities such as deposit and withdrawal operations contingent upon unique account identifiers. Notably, the implementation includes robust data persistence capabilities through the generation of files.

This project not only demonstrated proficiency in utilizing C++ for practical applications but also provided an invaluable opportunity to delve into the intricacies of object-oriented programming (OOP) principles. Through the development process, I honed my skills in designing modular and scalable solutions, further enriching my expertise in OOP.

# Development Environment

C++ stands out as one of the most renowned object-oriented programming languages, embodying a programming paradigm centered around the concept of 'objects' that encapsulate both data and the associated operations. Within the C++ ecosystem, the Standard Template Library (STL) serves as a robust collection of template classes and functions, offering versatile solutions for general-purpose programming tasks and algorithms. Notably, three integral components of the C++ Standard Library – iostream, fstream, and cstring – play pivotal roles in various aspects of C++ programming. iostream, though not part of the STL, is a crucial library component facilitating input and output operations. On the other hand, fstream, a true STL component, provides essential classes for managing file input and output operations. Lastly, cstring from the C Standard Library aids in handling strings as arrays of characters, contributing to effective string manipulation within C++ programs.

# Future Work

- After persisting data, the intention is to store it not only in a file but also within a database.
- I aim to create a new bank account by extracting information from a file.
